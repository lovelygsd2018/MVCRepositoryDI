MVC5/C# with Repository Pattern/Dependency Injection/Partial View/JQuery Ajax


--This application is used the following:

(1) Repository Pattern with Generic Repository
   -By using Repository Pattern, we can avoid code maintenance when their database needs to be changed.
(2 ) Dependency Injection with Unity
   -Dependency Injection in the Controller to avoid tightly coupling dependency on the Model.
   -By using DI and Repository Pattern, changing the Models does not impact on the Controller.
(3) C#, ASP.Net , JQuery Ajax to call the Controller to show partial views.
   -JQuery Ajax calls the methods in the Controller to show partial views and performs some actions.
(4 ) MVC5 with Entity Framework, Database first
  -In this application, Entity Framework is used as Data Access layer.
